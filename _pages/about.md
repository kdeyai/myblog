Hi , I am working as a Software Engineer in UST Blueconch ,Pune Maharashtra ,India . I am currently working with the innovation Group on Test case minimization , Test coverage , Defect classification and Bug prediction . 

I completed my Bachelors in Computer Science from Institute of Technical Education and Research , Siksha 'O' Anusandhan University . I love Math more than Computer Science and this love for mathematics has initiated my love for theoretical machine learning . I love writing blogs on Deep learning and trying to dig deep in various sub domains of deep learning. I am planning for a direct Ph.D. in this field and if everything goes well I will be joining a Ph.d. position soon . 

I have worked on various deep learning projects related to computer vision during bachelors .
